# SVM_training
This Python project trains a support vector machine (SVM) classifier and evaluates its performance using a confusion matrix. The model was trained on a dataset containing extracted features from EMG signals associated with different hand gestures, such as Wilson amplitude, RMS, and others.

## Technologies
- Scikit learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## features_extraction.py
This python script extracts relevant features from a raw EMG dataset.

## 92modelo.py
This python script trains a support vector machine model using GridSearchCV to find the optimal hyperparameters in order to achieve the best accuaracy.
